                            <p>
                                We created 17 Ways to provide a range of technology services to the Australian
                                market. As a small independent company with a wealth of experience
                                across a range of technologies and business areas, we can provide advice and services to your
                                business, whatever problems you may face. We know
                                that technology can be quite daunting. Our aim is to simplify it and help you to
                                make the right decisions.

                                The senior partners of 17 Ways are Tim, Mark and John. We began working at Macquarie Bank in 1997.
                                Over the next 17 years we worked
                                across all business lines within Macquarie which included living
                                and working in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the United States. We worked
                                on a wide range of activities including infrastructure design and
                                operations, architecture, as-a-Service solutions, company mergers, joint ventures, multi-year development programs, technology
                                and organisational change and offshoring. Prior to Macquarie we each had IT careers in industries as diverse as
                                health care, insurance and government.
