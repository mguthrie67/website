                            <p>
                                17 Ways was created to provide a range of technology services to the Australian
                                and Asian market. As a small independent company with a wealth of experience
                                across a range of technologies and business areas we can provide advice and services to your
                                business, whatever problems you may face. Our overheads are a lot lower than
                                many of our competitors which allows us to not only provide a really great service, but
                                to do it at a competitive price.

                                The senior partners of 17 Ways - Mark, Tim and John, all began working for Macquarie Bank around 1997.
                                Over the next 17 years they worked on a wide range of activities including infrastructure design and
                                operations, architecture, company mergers, joint ventures, multi-year development programs, technology
                                and organisational change and offshoring. Prior to Macquarie they worked in industries as diverse as
                                health care, insurance and government.

                                The number 17 comes from the number of years that we all spent at Macquarie. The compass logo and the
                                name <b>17 Ways</b> reflects our experience and our ability to look at all of the options such as
                                the 16 directions on a standard compass, and to come up with one more. Our slogan is <b>Options.
                                Solutions. Results.</b> which represents our approach to solving problems. We gather information and come
                                up with the best options, then we deliver the solution leading to the best results for our
                                customers. Or some shit like that anyway.
