Offshoring your technology teams or even outsourcing functions to a third party can offer real benefit to your company if it is done properly but real risk if it is done badly.
Before you head down this path talk to us. We have done it before, both building and operating our own captive centres in low cost locations and through outsourcing with partners.
We've even lived overseas to run it. <br>Talk to people who have real experience of what works and what doesn't and who can help you to get it right.
