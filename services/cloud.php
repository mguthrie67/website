<h1>Cloud for the Real World</h1>

<p>Cloud technology offers real opportunity for companies that can implement it correctly. But if you pick the wrong
use cases or fail to follow through and retire your legacy systems then cloud can be a very expensive folly.
</p>
<p>
Let <a href="../index.html">17 Ways</a> help you to get it right.

<p>
It is probably best to describe us as "Cloud Cynics". That doesn't mean that we are against cloud technology in any way,
in fact we are long time supporters and use it for all of our own infrastructure, it's more a reflection of our experience and the fact
that we have seen the dangers in getting it wrong by attempting to put the wrong things into the cloud or failing to understand
the full scope of what needs to be done to be successful.
</P>
<blockquote>Cloud is a great addition to your options as an IT professional. We can help you to use it for the right things and
follow through to get the best outcome.

<h2>What We Have Learnt</h2>
<p>Here are 3 of the main things to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>As with all technologies, consider the options and make a decision based on the head and not the heart. </li>
<li>Don't worry about what failure will look like, worry about what success will look like. How will you need to change WHEN cloud becomes mainstream for you.
Dipping your toe in is a precursor to a full dive. How will your organisation look once you are immersed.</li>
<li>Do a full cost benefit case and plan to follow through with any cost savings that involve retiring old systems or restructuring your teams.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How We Can Help</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>End-to-End Analysis of Cost and Benefit</dt>
        <dd>We can give you the whole picture including ROI and TCO analysis that includes the knock-on effects such as impact on other
            teams and early termination of existing contracts.</dd>
    <dt>Vendor Management</dt>
        <dd>With cloud adoption comes the need to depend upon a vendor for your critical systems. We have experience with initial negotiations,
        getting the best deal (and price isn't the key factor), setting up the relationship for ongoing success and planning for termination
        and change of vendors. We can help you with the whole lifecycle and if you involve us early we can set it up for success and smooth running.
        </dd>
    <dt>Selling the Change</dt>
        <dd>Any major change needs a lot of internal, and potentially external, selling. We have experience of selling
        change at all levels of large scale organisations and can help you to frame the right message so it is properly received.
        </dd>
    <dt>Choosing A Partner</dt>
        <dd>No we aren't a dating agency but it feels a bit like that when you are choosing a partner for your cloud solutions.
        We can ask the right questions to find someone who will be a good partner for you. We know the main players well and can find a good fit for you.
        </dd>
    <dt>Following Through</dt>
        <dd>Most cloud pitches include $xM of cost saving based upon eliminating processes, functions or headcount. We have done this for
        other organisations and can help you to realise your predicted benefits with appropriate implementations.
        </dd>
    <dt>Alternative</dt>
        <dd>You wouldn't look at a house and buy it without considering others. Committing to the cloud is a major undertaking and you should
        look at the alternatives, even if it is only to be sure that you are doing the right thing. We are experts in converged and hyper-converged
        systems. Even if you only use us for your free half day of consulting, we can help you to review your cloud solution to make sure it really\
        is right for the problems that you face.
        </dd>
    <dt>Cloud Rescue</dt>
        <dd>Even if you are having problems with your cloud implementation, it isn't too late to involve us. We are specialists at rescue. One of us
         even worked at the fire brigade so we are confident that if you call us, even if it is late in the process, we can help you.
         </dd>
