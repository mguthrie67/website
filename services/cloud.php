<p>Cloud technology offers real opportunity for companies that can implement it correctly. But if you pick the wrong
use cases or fail to follow through and retire your legacy systems then cloud can be a very expensive folly.
</p>
<p>
Let <a href="../index.html">17 Ways</a> help you to get it right.
</p>

<p>
It is probably best to describe us as "Cloud Cynics". That doesn't mean that we are against cloud technology in any way,
in fact we are long time supporters and use it for all of our own infrastructure, it's more a reflection of our experience and the fact
that we have seen the dangers in getting it wrong by attempting to put the wrong things into the cloud or failing to understand
the full scope of what needs to be done to be successful. Cloud is a great addition to your options as an IT professional but you need to get it right.

<h2>Our Experience</h2>
A few examples of our successes with cloud so far:
<dl>
    <dt>SaaS (Trading)</dt>
        <dd>Implemented 3 different SaaS solutions for trading systems in the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand between 2005 and 2011.</dd>
    <dt>SaaS (Salesforce)</dt>
        <dd>Integrated Salesforce into an inhouse FX trading application used at multiple companies.</dd>
    <dt>IaaS</dt>
        <dd>Built the internal VDI and VMWare farm solutions for a major Investment Bank.</dd>
    <dt>IaaS</dt>
        <dd>Currently advising an Australian household name on a cloud migration program.</dd>
    <dt>PaaS</dt>
        <dd>Built the Oracle, Sybase and SQLServer solutions for a major Investment Bank.</dd>

<h2>What We Have Learnt</h2>
<p>Here are 3 of the main things to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>As with all technologies, consider the options and make a decision based on the head and not the heart. </li>
<li>Don't worry about what failure will look like, worry about what success will look like. How will you need to change WHEN cloud becomes mainstream for you.
Dipping your toe in is a precursor to a full dive. How will your organisation look once you are immersed.</li>
<li>Do a full cost benefit case and plan to follow through with any cost savings that involve retiring old systems or restructuring your teams.</li>
</ol>

                        We can provide end-to-end analysis of both the cost and the benefits for you. We can give you the whole picture including ROI and TCO analysis that includes the knock-on effects such as impact on other
                        teams and early termination of existing contracts. We can also provide RTO and RPO calculations based upon your choice of provider.

                With cloud adoption comes the need to depend upon a vendor for your critical systems. We have experience with initial negotiations,
                           getting the best deal (and price isn't the key factor), setting up the relationship for ongoing success and planning for termination
                           and change of vendors. We can help you with the whole lifecycle and if you involve us early we can set it up for success and smooth running.</p>

                        Any major change needs a lot of internal, and potentially external, selling. We have experience of selling
