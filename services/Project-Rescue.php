<p>IT projects are complex and unpredictable things to manage. They require lots of experience and a high level of skill and coordination
if they are to be pulled off successfully. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value">
McKinsey found in 2012</a> that 45% of large projects run over budget and 56% of projects
under-deliver.
</p>
<p>
So if you find yourself involved in a project that is going badly, don't worry. You are in the majority. However don't let this fact make you complacent,
17% of large projects go so badly that they threaten the viability of the whole company.</p>
<p>
We have decades of experience running projects of all types and size, from multi-million dollar programs spanning several years to joint ventures and new company set ups.
Our experience positions us well to help you with your project issues.

                 Get us in as soon as things start to go badly. The earlier we are involved the more likely we are to be able to help you.
                 It is always tempting when things are going badly to give them "time to fix themselves". Very rarely does a project get back on track
                 by itself without external intervention.

    We have access to some of the best PMs around. If you need a full time or part time PM we can help. The importance of a good PM to the success
    of a project cannot be overstated. Often people think they have it under control because someone is performing the function of a project administrator
    and producing lots of nice reports. A good PM does a lot more than this. <br><br>

We can help to build and sell the message about your project including ROI, risk mitigation, evaluation of alternatives and the cost of doing nothing.
Without effective sponsorship projects rarely succeed. We have lots of experience of dealing with senior business staff and can help you to
get that sponsorship.

We can help you work out the real cost of your project, as well as the full value proposition. In our experience people start projects
with an overoptimistic view of the effort and cost. TCO is often really based on a partial cost as knock on effects to other areas are not
fully considered. The same is also true of the benefits case. Let us help you to get to the true costs and benefits of your project.

skills and abilities to the right parts, at the right time, is a complex thing to achieve. We can help you to get this right.
