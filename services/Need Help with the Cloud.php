<p>Cloud technology offers real opportunity for companies that can implement it correctly. But if you pick the wrong
use cases or fail to follow through and retire your legacy systems then cloud can be a very expensive folly.

                        We can provide end-to-end analysis of both the cost and the benefits for you. We can give you the whole picture including ROI and TCO analysis that includes the knock-on effects such as impact on other
                        teams and early termination of existing contracts. We can also provide RTO and RPO calculations based upon your choice of provider.

                With cloud adoption comes the need to depend upon a vendor for your critical systems. We have experience with initial negotiations,
                           getting the best deal (and price isn't the key factor), setting up the relationship for ongoing success and planning for termination
                           and change of vendors. We can help you with the whole lifecycle and if you involve us early we can set it up for success and smooth running.</p>

                        Any major change needs a lot of internal, and potentially external, selling. We have experience of selling
                           change at all levels of large scale organisations and can help you to frame the right message so it is properly received.
