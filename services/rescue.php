<h1>Project Rescue</h1>
<img src="../images/services/umbrella.jpg" alt="Cloud IT Umbrella" width="600px">
<p>IT projects are complex and unpredictable things to manage and require experience and a high level of skill and cooperation
if they are to be pulled of successfully. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value">
McKinsey found in 2012</a> that 45% of large projects run over budget and 56% of projects
under-deliver.
</p>
<p>
So if you find yourself involved in a project that is going badly, don't worry. You are in the majority. However don't let this fact make you complacent,
17% of large projects go so badly that they threaten the viability of the whole company.</p>

<blockquote>We can help you get your project back on track, or salvage the parts that can be saved.
</blockquote>
<p>
We have decades of experience running projects of all sizes and types, experience that positions us well to help you with your project issues.

 </dl>

<h2>What We Have Learnt</h2>
<p>Here are some of the main things to consider for a successful project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend longer than you think you need on getting the requirements right upfront. Don't be tempted to jump in until you know what you are trying to achieve.</li>
<li>Break large projects up into smaller chunks and deliver benefit as quickly as you can.</li>
<li>Stay flexible. Work very closely with your stakeholders and encourage flexibility on both sides.</li>
<li>Rely on a good project manager over a good project methodology.</li>
<li>Be honest about progress and issues. All projects go up and down, the failures are usually the ones who hide the downs.</li>
</ol>
