<p>IT projects are complex and unpredictable things to manage. They require lots of experience and a high level of skill and coordination
if they are to be pulled off successfully. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value">
McKinsey found in 2012</a> that 45% of large projects run over budget and 56% of projects
under-deliver.
</p>
<p>
So if you find yourself involved in a project that is going badly, don't worry. You are in the majority. However don't let this fact make you complacent,
17% of large projects go so badly that they threaten the viability of the whole company.</p>
<p>
We have decades of experience running projects of all sizes and types, experience that positions us well to help you with your project issues.

<h2>Our Experience</h2>
A few examples of our successes with projects:
<dl>
    <dt>Software</dt>
        <dd>Multi-year, multi-million dollar program to completely redevelop FX trading applications for an Investment Bank. Completed successfully and structured in a way that the ROI
        was delivered part way through the project.</dd>
    <dt>Infrastructure</dt>
        <dd>Development and implementation of PaaS for a bank. Completed on time and within budget and successfully tracked against a 5 year adoption program.</dd>
    <dt>Join Ventures</dt>
        <dd>Joint ventures in New Zealand, Hong Kong and The Middle East to implement trading and risk management systems. Significant business value delivered.</dd>
    <dt>Separations</dt>
        <dd>Separation programs to allow acquisitions to operate without support from the old parent company.</dd>
    <dt>Packages</dt>
        <dd>Selection, evaluation, implementation and rollout of software packages for use cases such as DNS Management, Systems Management, SDLC and trading systems.</dd>
 </dl>


<h2>What We Have Learnt</h2>
<p>Here are some of the main things to consider for a successful project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend longer than you think you need on getting the requirements right upfront. Don't be tempted to jump in until you know what you are trying to achieve.</li>
<li>Break large projects up into smaller chunks and deliver benefit as quickly as you can.</li>
<li>Stay flexible. Work very closely with your stakeholders and encourage flexibility on both sides.</li>
<li>Rely on a good project manager over a good project methodology.</li>
<li>Be honest about progress and issues. All projects go up and down, the failures are usually the ones who hide the downs.</li>
</ol>

                 Get us in as soon as things start to go badly. The earlier we are involved the more likely we are to be able to help you.
                 It is always tempting when things are going badly to give them "time to fix themselves". Very rarely does a project get back on track
                 by itself without external intervention.

    We have access to some of the best PMs around. If you need a full time or part time PM we can help. The importance of a good PM to the success
    of a project cannot be overstated. Often people think they have it under control because someone is performing the function of a project administrator
    and producing lots of nice reports. A good PM does a lot more than this. <br><br>

We can help you work out the real cost of your project, as well as the full value proposition. In our experience people start projects
with an overoptimistic view of the effort and cost. TCO is often really on a partial cost as knock on effects to other areas are not
fully considered. The same is also true of the benefits case. Let us help you to get to the true costs and benefits of your project.
