<p>We are experienced at working in high pressure environments where very large pieces of work come up suddenly, and we are used to responding to get them done.
Whether it is a sudden change such as an acquisition or a gradual change such as the realisation that you need to lift your game on Service Management or Business Engagement, we
can help you.

17 Ways have had exposure to a wide range of IT organisational designs and structures. Within our corporate experience we have been involved in shaping and running a wide variety of infrastructure and development teams.
<br>Having built out and run many teams and organisational structures we have seen what works and what does not. We can draw on our corporate experience to give you an independent view of IT organisational design.

At 17 Ways we have had significant experience with outsourcing and offshoring. We have seen some real successes and some very poor implementations. We have seen a lot of the traps and pitfalls and can give independent advice on the merits of sourcing and shoring strategies.
<br>Our partners have experience running tenders with major vendors for sourcing, particularly for IT infrastructure.
<br>We have been involved in selecting and building out a captive centre in Manila with 1000+ staff, with one of our partners having relocated to Manila to run a team of 500+ developers and testers in the Philippines and India.
<br>Our experience has given us an understanding of the cultural, technical and political issues required to make off shoring a success.

Business engagement is not traditionally a core strength of IT functions. While we know the importance of engaging the business and understanding the goals of the businesses we work for, it is easy to fall into a pattern of working at arm's length from the business.
<br>In our corporate experience, each of the 17 Ways partners have worked as account managers for business divisions. We understand the importance of IT relationships with the business and have seen what works and what does not.
<br>We have experience operating within senior levels of business divisions and we can help our clients work out the best approach to engage with their businesses.
<br>Approaching things from a different angle, we can also help businesses understand and work with their IT departments.

17 Ways have extensive experience and skills in service management and service management frameworks, primarily in ITIL.
<br>Besides our theoretical knowledge of service management, our partners have been through two major Remedy upgrades, and have run incident management, change management and problem management functions for a major investment bank.
<br>The incident management function involved all aspects of managing severity 1 incidents, including issue resolution, return-to-service and business communications and engagement. We provided 24x7 support services and post-incident analysis and review.
