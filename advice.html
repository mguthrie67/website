        <p>
            At 17 Ways we have a wealth of experience with technology. There is an old saying that you should learn from others mistakes, because there isn't
            enough time to make them all yourself. Our experience covers application development, application operations, architecture, infrastructure,
            due diligence, mergers and separations, offshoring, systems integration, vendor management, account management and dentistry. Ok, we don't know
            anything about dentistry but we do know a lot about the other categories.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need advice on technology ask us. The first meeting is always free and we are happy to talk about our experiences even if you choose not
            to have a full engagement with us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Call us on 1300 17WAYS (1300 179297) or email us at <a href="mailto:info@17ways.com.au">info@17ways.com.au</a> today to arrange a free, no obligation first meeting.

        <h2 id="dd">Virtual CIO</h2>
        <p>
            Compared to other professional services industries the IT industry is fairly immature. It is relatively easy to get a lawyer, accountant or auditor to
            work with your company, but it is far harder to engage a senior IT person. IT operates more like a trade than a profession. In the same way you can get
            a plumber or electrician called out to help you, you can get a PC engineer or a web designer quite easily in the IT space. However if you want to get someone
            to help with your strategy, to negotiate for you with a vendor or to review your processes and look for improvements then you pretty quickly find yourself at
            the high end of town dealing with an army of consultants who are looking for ways to improve their business, rather than ways to improve yours.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 17 Ways we think there should be a better way. We offer a virtual CIO services which is much more similar to the way lawyers and accountants operate. We'll get to
            know your business and give you advice on what you should focus on and when you need to use our experience you only pay for the time that you need.
        </p>

        <h2 id="dd">Due Diligence</h2>
        <p>
            We have extensive experience with Due Diligence work and can advise you on the key things to consider if you are looking to take over another company
            and there will be a technology component involved. We have been involved in DD work around the globe and are happy to share our knowledge with you. If you
            prefer we can run the DD for you or work with you to do the actual work.
        </p>
            <h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
            <p>
                We specialise in Data Centre hardware. The three senior partners have all spent more time than we care to admit inside Data Centres. The Data Centre
                is evolving faster now than at any time in its history and there are some real benefits to be realised if you implement the current Converged technologies
                properly. We are happy to engage with you to ensure that you get the most out of your Data Centre investments. We can also assist you in a proper
                evaluation of Cloud infrastructure and help you to avoid the major pitfalls if you decide to go down this route.
            </p>
            <h2 id="mergers">Mergers and Separations</h2>
            <p>
                The merging and separating of technology as a result of corporate changes can be a daunting endeavour. The first few times that you work on one of
                these it can seem as if the work will never be done. Having done a large number of these over many years we are well placed to help you. By following
                a few simple guidelines and focusing on the most critical activities, even the largest technology marriage or divorce can be achieved.
            </p>
            <h2 id="offshoring">Offshoring</h2>
            <p>
                What can safely be offshored? Should you build a captive capability or work with a partner? Where should you go? What needs to change in the rest of the organisation
                for this to be successful?
            </p>
            <p>
                We can help you to answer all of these questions and more. We have contacts and relationships across several countries that can be used to get you up and running
                and working towards a better and more cost effective technology outcome quickly and easily.
            </p>
            <h2 id="orgchange">Organisational Change</h2>
            <p>
                Organisational Change can be difficult to achieve and often requires an external push to make it successful. However modern IT approaches
                such as Dev/Ops, Offshoring, Converged Infrastructure and Agile Development cannot be fully successful without Organisational Change.
                We can advise you on the changes that you need to make or put our people on the ground with you to work through the changes.
            </p>
            <h2 id="leadership">Leadership Development and Mentoring</h2>
            <p>
                We have practical experience of running teams with time sizes from less than 10 all the way up to teams of over 600. We have managed
                Leadership development, mentored hundreds of people over the years and even run in-house Leadership Development programs. Having successful,
                motivated and well trained leaders is essential for any corporate looking to get the most out of their IT investments. Talk to us if you
                need help with building your leadership teams or would like us to provide one-on-one mentoring or coaching for any of your staff.
