<p>
More than 30,000 new applications are added to the Apple Store every month and there are 1.5m apps available as of July 2015.
The Google Play store has even more with 1.6m apps. Social media is now 60% attributed to mobile and tablet platforms and
even conservative estimates suggest that 30% of all web traffic originates from mobile devices. Some estimates put it over 60%.

<p>As we will see below it is now quite easy to develop an app and push it to an online store, so how many of these are 'real' applications and
how many are 'Hello World' apps is another question. Nonetheless it is undeniably important for most organisations to be able to push their content
to mobile devices.</p>

<p>Interestingly Google now assesses websites based upon how they perform and render on smartphones and will downgrade
a site in its rankings if it isn't built properly for smaller screens. This means that even if you are only targeting desktop and laptop
users with your site, they won't be able to find you unless the site works on a smartphone. </p>

<h2>What Are You Trying To Do?</h2>
<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/design.jpg" width="150px" style="float: right; margin: 5px 15px 0px 15px; ">
<p>
    Before you go all the way into building an app, ask yourself what it is that you are trying to achieve.
    </p><p>Remember, even if you
    have an app, that doesn't mean people will want to use it. If your app has exactly the same information as your website then
    people are much more likely to visit your website than to download and install yet another app on their already crowded
    smartphone screen. You need a compelling reason for people to use your app or you are wasting time and money on building one.
</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<blockquote>The UN estimates that more people have access to mobile phones than toilets. You need to make sure that your message works properly on a mobile platform.</blockquote>
<p>
    Here are a few common mistakes and alternatives that you should consider first:
</p>
<ul class="myList">
    <li>Having a "Presence" - if you run a small business and want to have a presence on the web consider using social media or just
    building a good website. You will reach far more people and much more easily. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc have already done
    the hard work for you by getting their apps installed on mobile devices. All you need to do is to manage the content and focus on
    making that interesting enough for people to want to follow you.</li>
    <li>Largely Static Content - if your message doesn't change regularly and you aren't offering a real app to users then even if
    you can persuade them to install it to begin with, your app will soon be relegated to a sub-folder somewhere or deleted altogether.
    Think about the apps that you use regularly. They are probably very dynamic - social media, transport information, news, maps, stock prices etc.</li>
    <li>
        Half-hearted Apps - if you aren't committed to maintaining and enhancing the content of your app then it will go stale very quickly.
        You will end up with an app that reflects negatively on your company. If you have unfinished features ("Under Construction", "Coming Soon") or
        your app is generally unappealing then you are turning people off, and not on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile app users have the attention of a goldfish. If you develop an app it needs to be compelling.
    </p>
<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/bar.jpg">
<br>
<p>Consider for example that you run a bar and
decide that an app with some information about your bar and a price list with opening times would be a nice thing to have. Think how quickly that
 app will go stale compared to an app that uses geolocation to recognise that you are near the bar and gives you directions, has the ability to advertise
specials, has a clickable menu to order drinks or food and a built-in loyalty program that gives you a free drink every 5 visits.</p>

<h2>How To Build Your App</h2>
<p>So you have decided that social media isn't enough for you and you want to get your content to mobile devices. How can you do it?</p>
<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/dev-options-for-mobile.JPG">

<h3>Web Page</h3>
<p>You almost certainly have a website already if you are considering building an app. Why not extend the functionality of the website to
do what your app will do? Hopefully you have built your website in a technology that is 'responsive' (i.e. adapts to the size of the screen
that it is being shown on). Most content management systems like WordPress use responsive technologies. Alternatively if you build the site
yourself you can use a framework like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to ensure that your site looks good on a desktop or
mobile screen. This site is built using bootstrap as you can see in the screenshots below.

<h3>Builder Applications</h3>
<p>
There are dozens of websites that you can use to generate
a fully functional app for iPhone or Android with a few clicks of your mouse.
</p>
<p>Some of the better ones include <a href="my.como.com">Como</a>, <a href="appsbar.com">Appsbar</a> and <a href="appmakr.com">AppMakr</a>.</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing that you can knock up in only a few minutes. This example is from Como.</p>

<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/como-screenshot1.jpg">

<p>The problem with these tools though is that you really can't do much more than just put together basic features. They are good for contact information
and simple forms but they are not suitable for building more advanced applications. As mentioned above, if you are going to keep your customers
using your app, you will need to give them more than just photos of your cat looking cute.</p>

<h3>Native Applications</h3>

<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/code.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px 15px 0px 15px; ">

<p>Roll up your sleeves, get a bucket of coffee and stack your top pocket with pens. Its time to do some real development.
</p>
<p>
You will need to do some actual programming for this and set yourself up with a proper development environment. The good news however
    is that the tools are very advanced and there are tons of resources on the internet to help you get started.
</p>
<blockquote>Apple's choice of development language is Objective-C. It's not so much a language as a series of grunts.</blockquote>
<p>For iPhone and iPad development you will need a Mac. It is the only platform supported. You'll also need to download XCode which
is massive, and sign up to Apple's developer program which is $100 per year. That is a lot if you only want to play with it but
a real bargain for serious developers given everything that it will give you access to. The less said about Objective-C the better.
It is an awful language but you really don't have any alternative. There are a few tools that can generate code for you from
higher level languages but they aren't mainstream options. If you want to go down this path then take a look at <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc">PyObjC</a>
which provides a bridge from Python to Objective-C. You will still need to learn a fair bit of Objective-C in order to make it work, and
it does drag Python down towards the level of Objective-C, but it is a slight improvement. Apple recognise the problems with trying to
develop apps in Objective-C and have introduced a new language, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>, however adoption is
slow and you will find it harder to get developers with Swift skills. It is also possible that Swift will fail and end up being unsupported
while with the huge volume of apps out there, it is hard to see that happening to Objective-C.</p>
<p>In case you think I am being a bit unfair to Objective-C, have a look at this code which is the top answer on stackoverflow for the question
"How do I reverse an array in Objective-C?"</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">

    @implementation NSArray (Reverse)

    - (NSArray *)reversedArray {
        NSMutableArray *array = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[self count]];
        NSEnumerator *enumerator = [self reverseObjectEnumerator];
        for (id element in enumerator) {
            [array addObject:element];
        }
        return array;
    }

    @end

    @implementation NSMutableArray (Reverse)

    - (void)reverse {
        if ([self count] <= 1)
            return;
        NSUInteger i = 0;
        NSUInteger j = [self count] - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            [self exchangeObjectAtIndex:i
            withObjectAtIndex:j];

            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }

    @end
</pre>
<p>
    Yup, that gibberish does the same thing as this bit of Python:

</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
a=[4,6,5,1,8,3]
a.reverse()
</pre>

<p>Objective-C is only one part of the puzzle though, you will also have to learn Cocoa which is the API into the Apple world. If you like
history you will find that a lot of the Cocoa API has calls with NS in the name, like NSEnumerator and NSUInteger above. The NS stands for NeXTSTEP
which was the operating system that Steve Jobs developed when he left Apple in 1985 and formed NeXT. Apple bought the company and Jobs with it in 1997 and
    replaced their dated operating system with the nice stuff they got from NeXT.
Back in the 80s having to allocate and free up your own memory was all the rage, as were scary perms and pogo sticks, but unfortunately we've ended up
    keeping the wrong one out of those three.</p>
<p>If you decide to develop for Android then it is slightly easier as you can develop in Java. You will need to learn and use the Android SDK but again
the tools are quite advanced. You also aren't restricted to developing on a Mac and you don't need to pay anything to get started.</p>
<p>If you think its still the 90s you can build an app for Blackberry using Java and their SDK as well. There is also probably an SDK for Windows Phone
apps but frankly it wouldn't make much difference if there wasn't. My brother is the only person I've ever heard of who uses a Windows Phone and I
think he got it free.</p>

<h3>Hybrid Tools</h3>
<p>
Hybrid tools offer the promise of developing once and deploying to multiple mobile platforms. This is a very appealing option
if you want to develop for more than one platform at the same time. It does however come with some downsides. Firstly, you are
going to have to pick a technology in a fast moving market, which is always a problem for early adoptors. Secondly the
abstraction layers introduce performance overhead, so if you aren't careful your app won't work well, especially on
older devices. The third major problem can be finding experienced developers, although this may not be too big an issue
if you pick a tool that uses a well known technology such as Java or HTML5.
</p>
<p>
    <h4>So how does it work?</h4>
</p>
<p>
    Actually there are lots of ways to do this, but let's look at one of the leading products, <a href="http://phonegap.com">Phonegap</a>, and see how it works.
    The basic premise is that you can now do a lot with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript running inside a browser. What if we took all of that and
    ran it inside the same sort of container as the browser but without the browser controls (back, history, address bar, etc) and with access to some
    of the things that browser isn't allowed to do, like using the camera and talking to other apps.
</p>
<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/phonegap.jpg">
<p>
So now you can basically build an app that goes to the edge of the screen without the browser being present, but you can use all
    of the nice things that you used to build your web pages plus you can use the Phoneapp API to do the things that a native app
    can do.
</p>
<p>
    <h4>What's the downside?</h4>
</p>
<p>
    Initially there was quite a lot of downside to this kind of approach. The classes that implement the browser features (UIWebView for IOS
    and Android.webkit.WebView for Android) were not built to be full app environments, they were intended to allow you to show some HTML inside
    a real app. As such they didn't perform very well and were missing things such as Just In Time (JIT) compilation for JavaScript. This has improved
    and now that this type of hybrid app is using it in this way, there is more effort to improve performance. The second issue was that most
    web developers were addicted to frameworks such as DOJO and jQuery. These are quite big libraries and using them impacted performance while
    not using them impacted productivity and hurt the feelings of the developers. Thankfully now there are options such as <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a>
    and <a href="htpp://sencha.com/products/touch">Sencha Touch</a> which are built for the mobile world. They even allow you to build cut down
    runtime versions that only have the features you are actually using.
</p>
<p>
    All of this innovation is making hybrid development much more feasible but there are still obstacles to overcome to make this as easy as
    we would like. Also don't believe the "write once, deploy everywhere" hype as you will still need to do a lot of testing and tweaking
    across the different platforms.
</p>
<blockquote>It seems like every week there is an announcement about some major platform either moving to, or moving away from the hybrid approach. Increased
performance and/or productivity is usually the reason in both directions.</blockquote>
<p>If you want to look at this space then in addition to <a href="http://phonegap.com">Phonegap</a> you should also consider
    <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/product/">Titanium</a>, <a href="http://www.kony.com/products/studio">Kony</a>,
    <a href="http://xamarin.com">Xamarin</a> and <a href="http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder">Icenium</a>.</p>

        <td>Cross-platform without additional development.</td>
        <td>Look and feel can be different between IOS and Android.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Back End</h3>
<p>Whether you choose to build a native or a hybrid app, for most purposes the mobile environment won't be enough for you,
you will need some kind of back end for your application that you access over the web. This is to give you persistence (database)
    and communication outside your mobile device.
</P>
<img src="../../images/Library/TECH/backend.jpg">
<p>
While on the face of it this might seem like a whole load more hassle, in fact it is extremely good news. The back end technologies are
very advanced and if you structure your application properly then you can put a lot of the business logic (in theory all of it) in to the
back end. This protects you against making the wrong choices in your front end technology as there will be less to port to a new
technology if you get it wrong.
</p>
<p>
Node.js is getting a lot of attention and allows you to write your backend code in the same technology that you are using for
your frontend (JavaScript), however personally I'd stick to something more established like Java, Python or PHP. REST seems to be
winning as the protocol and JSON as the payload but before I start World War III here, this isn't really the purpose of this
article any way. Write it in whatever you like, you won't go far wrong.
