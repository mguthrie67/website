<h1>Why You Should Look At SimpliVity</h1>
<h3>Part of our Tech Series of articles aimed at technologists</h3>
<p>At 17 Ways we are looking to partner with the providers of the best technologies so that we can help our clients
    to implement the right solutions. That doesn't mean that these technologies will always be right for your specific
    circumstance, but it does mean that we are prepared to put our name behind them and if the problem that you are
    trying to solve is a good fit then we are confident that these technologies will be right for you. We are working
    to become partners with a number of technology companies and our latest signing is SimpliVity. This article will
    explain what we believe are the strengths of the SimpliVity product and hopefully let you understand why we are choosing to
    back it.

<h2>Data Centre in a Box</h2>

<p>
Fundamentally SimpliVity provide a Data Centre in a Box. It is a hyper-converged solution delivered in physically small units that
you can add to as your requirements grow (up to 32 nodes). Each unit has everything you need to run a VMWare farm - storage, compute,
compression, de-duplication, SSD and even backup. Add more nodes to your cluster and it even covers disaster recovery for you automatically
with offsite snapshotting happening in near real time.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a VMWare architect or administrator then SimpliVity is all you will need underneath you to do your job. To manage
    it you don't even need a new UI. It is administered through a plug in to vCenter. You don't need to understand LUNs or SCSI channels
    or anything else about storage for that matter, SimpliVity takes care of all of that for you. You don't need to put in requests
    to other teams to get things set up, you just do it through VCenter.

<blockquote>Think of SimpliVity as a hardware add on to vCenter.</blockquote>
<h2>The Competition</h2>
<p>
This is a very active space at the moment and SimpliVity are certainly not the only player, so why are we recommending their product over
say, Nutanix or EVO:RAIL? Well first let's be clear that it will depend upon your specific situation. 17 Ways are happy to talk to you about
your needs and help to recommend the right solution. If, for example, you are using Hyper-V or KVM as your hypervisor and not VMWare's vSphere then
Nutanix is probably a better option for you. If you are running very high end critical systems then Vblock could be the answer.
However for general workloads (<i>see below for use cases</i>) with all things being equal, we think you should take a good look at
SimpliVity because it is 3rd generation converged technology built from the ground up to do the job it does.

    Let's look at what it does and why we believe it is the right choice. We'll start at the storage layer.
