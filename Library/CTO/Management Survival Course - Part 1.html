Finding your way through the world of Corporate IT (or any other Corporate leadership role for that matter)
    can be a difficult task. We believe that there are 3 main things to
    focus on:
    <ol>
    <li>
        <b>Managing Yourself.</b> Before you can hope to manage others you need to be able to sort out your own affairs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Communicating with Others.</b> Being an effective communicator is essential to being a good leader.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Leading Teams.</b> Once you have the first two under your belt, you can work on being a good manager and leader.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    This article presents some tips and tricks on how to address the first of these - Managing Yourself. If you want
    motivational, self-help books there are plenty to choose from, but this isn't one of them. What we cover here are
    core, simple techniques that we have learnt, not from books, but from many years of operating in the Corporate world.
    We don't suggest that all of these are applicable to every situation, or that any of them are silver bullets, but hopefully
    one of two of the techniques presented here will be of some use to you.

    <h2>Self Awareness</h2>

<p>Let's start with something pretty awkward so we get it out of the way early. If you don't know who you are then you
    are really going to struggle in management. That doesn't mean you need to pose in front of a mirror or watch lots of
    videos of yourself (but that would help). What it means is you need to know what your own strengths and weaknesses are
    and be prepared to admit them to yourself, if not others.
