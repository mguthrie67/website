        <blockquote>Obsolete servers are a drain on your budget and resources.
            They are costing you money to keep alive. Let us show you the
            benefits of getting rid of your old servers.</blockquote>


        <p>Decommissioning "comatose" servers in your data center is
        not always an easy task. You need to audit your server fleet, work out
        which devices are not used, co-ordinate with business owners to turn off
        the devices and then decommission the servers. Not all IT divisions do this
        in a structured and regular way, and there is always the risk of "what if we turn off the wrong server?".
        </p>
        <p>
            However, when you stop to consider the total cost of unused servers,
            it will likely make good business sense to put the effort into decommissioning those servers.
        </p>
        <p>
        The immediate cost saving that jumps out is the power savings, approximately $400
        per annum for a 4RU server <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1015715">
        http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1015715</a>. However, there are a number of other
        one-off and recurring costs that should be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>

            Costs include:

        <ul class="myList">
            <li>Power
            <li>Cooling / Heating</li>
            <li>Data Centre space lease or ownership costs per square meter</li>
            <li>Network ports, usually at least 2 per server</li>
            <li>SAN connections, usually at least 2 per server</li>
            <li>Backups</li>
            <li>Monitoring</li>
            <li>Patching</li>
            <li>Operating System License</li>
            <li>Database License</li>
            <li>Hardware Maintenance Agreement</li>
            <li>SAN Storage</li>
            <li>Administration and Support</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            While we do not enumerate all of these costs due to their variance from server to server,
            a conservative estimate based on a 4RU x86 server running Windows 2012 Enterprise and

            Microsoft SQL with SAN attached storage would give $5,000 per annum in recurring
            costs and $1,000 in one-off costs.
        </p>
        <blockquote>Zombie servers in your Data Centre could be costing you over $5000 each year to run.</blockquote>

        <p>
            Costs to decommission servers will vary based on scale, however a good starting
            point is 8 hours per IT resource per server at $125 per hour ($1,000 per server), and
            $800 per 4RU server for removal from data center and disposal. This gives a total of
            approximately $1,800 per server in decommission costs.
        </p>
        <blockquote>Even a high estimate of the decommissioning cost is less than $2000.</blockquote>
