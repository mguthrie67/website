A man goes into a village pub which is full of locals. After a few minutes one of the locals stands up and shouts
    "23!". Everyone starts laughing. A few minutes later another guy shouts out "12!", and again everyone laughs.
    The stranger asks the barman what is going on.

<p>
    "Oh we got tired of telling the same old jokes." the barman tells him, "So we numbered them. Now instead of telling
    the joke we just shout out the number."
    </p>
<p>
    "I see." says the stranger, "Let me try." and he shouts out "42!". The whole pub erupts in laughter that goes on for
    ages. When it finally stops he says to the barman "How come they are laughing so hard at that one?"

    And the barman says "It's because they've never heard it before."

    In a nutshell that joke explains data compression and de-duplication which we will come back to shortly.

<h2>Virtualisation</h2>
In <a href="../CEO/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Data%20Centre.html">A Brief History of the Data Centre</a> we
discussed how Data Centres have evolved over the past few decades. One of the most significant changes has been the
move to virtualisation. By running multiple virtual machines on a single physical server comapnies have been able
to reduce cost and speed up delivery considerably. The dominant product in this space is VMWare. Depending upon whose
data you believe, VMWare has somewhere between 51% and 89% of the virtualisation hypervisor market. While other products
such as Microsoft's Hyper-V and Citrix XenServer are slowly catching up, VMWare still consistenly comes out ahead in
reviews.
<h2>Data Centre in a Box</h2>
Underneath the hypervisor layer typically sits a prethora of infrastructure. Compute servers inside chassis inside racks
connected over a SAN to Storage with backup systems, monitoring systems and often a number of other things thrown in.
With converged or hyper-converged systems these functions are
