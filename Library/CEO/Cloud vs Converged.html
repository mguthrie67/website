                <p>
                    If you believe all of the hype then you should move your IT systems to the Cloud and give up on your own Data Centre. Is this really the
                    right approach? What makes sense to move to the Cloud and what doesn't?
                    In this article we look to answer these questions and aim to identify when the Cloud is your best solution and
                    when you should be running it yourself.
                </p>
                <p>In <a href="An%20Introduction%20to%20Cloud%20Computing.html">An Introduction to Cloud Computing</a> we looked
                    at Cloud technologies and some of the benefits and issues that exist with this technology. In <a href="A%20Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Data%20Centre.html">
                        A Brief History of the Data Centre</a> we looked at the evolution of Data Centre technology over the last 30 years and introduced Converged Infrastructure.
