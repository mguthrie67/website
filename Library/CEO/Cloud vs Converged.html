                <h3>Part of our CEO Series of articles aimed at business people who need to know more about technology.</h3>

                <p>
                    If you believe all of the hype then you should move your IT systems to the Cloud and give up on your own Data Centre. Is this really the
                    right approach? What makes sense to move to the Cloud and what doesn't?
                    In this article we look to answer these questions and aim to identify when the Cloud is your best solution and
                    when you should be running it yourself.
                </p>
                <p>In <a href="An%20Introduction%20to%20Cloud%20Computing.html">An Introduction to Cloud Computing</a> we looked
                    at Cloud technologies and some of the benefits and issues that exist with this technology. In <a href="A%20Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Data%20Centre.html">
                        A Brief History of the Data Centre</a> we looked at the evolution of Data Centre technology over the last 30 years and introduced Converged Infrastructure.
                    If you need more background on the topics discussed here then we recommend that you read these articles first.

<h2>Web-Scale vs Traditional Data Centre</h2>
<p>Web-scale emerged to solve a different set of problems from those that the traditional corporate IT world had been working on for many decades.
</p>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/webscalevtraditional.png"><br><br>
<p>
    Having said that, many of the approaches developed for Web-scale are equally applicable to corporates and in that sense Web-scale represents a disruptive and extremely healthy threat to the
traditional models of corporate IT.
    <blockquote>The secret to getting the most out of the new technology is to identify where it will work for you; i.e. the overlap in the picture above.</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    The easiest way to understand Cloud is to think of it as the coming together of two different things; <b>the application of Web-scale approaches to traditional corporate IT problems</b>.
    In other words, the Cloud represents the overlap in the picture above with the problems we are trying to solve coming from the traditional corporate IT world and the possible solutions
    coming from the Internet companies' world.
</p>
<h3>Comparison Table</h3>
<p>
    As we are fond of saying at 17 Ways - the Cloud is often a solution looking for a problem.
Lets look at this from another angle and consider the drivers that are typically found in both environments.

    Look down the two lists and tick which more closely matches the problem that you are trying to solve. Add up the totals and if Web-Scale
    scores higher than Traditional then the Cloud is probably the right answer for you. If not, look again at the Traditional Data Centre approach.
</blockquote>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
The focus of many companies Cloud strategy starts with the infrastructure. This is driven by a belief that by adopting the Cloud, costs will reduce,
speed to market will increase and performance will become truly scalable. The problem with this is that infrastructure achieves none of these things. It is
applications that will be the true deliverers of the Cloud benefits, infrastructure is merely the layer upon which your applications run. Its a bit like
adopting a new guage of train tracks. Sure it might be a better size and easier to lay the rails but until you have some trains that will fit on it you
are wasting your time.
</p>
<blockquote>Don't ask your Infrastructure teams about the Cloud. Ask your Development teams. If they can see a benefit then push forward.</blockquote>
<p>
    The standardisation that the Cloud can bring to your deployments is of great value for new applications but for existing applications it is a huge problem.
    In the traditional Data Centre model the infrastructure provides an extremely flexible service for the applications. If an application needs a certain
    package installed, the infrastructure team install it, if it needs the database search to be case sensitive, then it get it. In the Cloud model the
    application development teams are forced down a standardised path. Be very careful if you are presented with a TCO figure for your company's Cloud migration.
    It is very likely that this figure only include infrastructure cost and exclude what can be massive additional costs for the Development teams.
</p>
<p>
    The Cloud isn't a revolutionary technology like PCs or the Internet, it is a new way to do the same old thing. As an end user you can't really tell if
    you are using the Cloud or not and for that reason Cloud adoption should be driven by your application
    development teams, they are the ones who can see the benefits and weigh them against the risks.
</p>
<h2>Converged Infrastructure</h2>
As we covered in the article <a href="A%20Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Data%20Centre.html">A Brief History of the Data Centre</a>, the comparison between the Cloud
and traditional Data Centre technologies is no longer applicable. Data Centre technology has moved on significantly in the past few years with the emergence of
Converged and Hyper-Converged technology. If you set them up properly then these systems are significantly cheaper to run than previous technology and offer many
of the benefits of the Cloud without the downside. We consider running your own converged technology to be a serious and often compelling alternative to mass adoption of
the Cloud.
