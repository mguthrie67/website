<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
The primary motivation for looking at offshoring your IT testing is cost. The labour arbitrage between Australia and India or Manila is still a large enough
factor to tempt people in to considering an offshore testing function. However if this is your only reason for doing it then you are not only missing out
on some big opportunities but you are also likely to be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
    Organisations that focus only on the cost benefits can lose sight of the overall value they are receiving.

<p>
    It is common to find organisations that have attempted to offshore their testing functions and see the output and effectiveness drop significantly as a result.
    The difference between organisations that are successful and those that fail is what we will look at in this article. By far the biggest factors in failure are
    a lack of commitment and the destructive power of naysayers.
</p>
<blockquote>Any organisation can make offshore testing successful if they have a long term commitment to it.</blockquote>
<p>
    An additional motivation is also often to break up the onshore testing and try to start again. Einstein's definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over
    and over again and expecting different results. If you don't learn from your previous experiences with testing then you will be doomed to repeat them, only this
    time it will be worse as it will be a long distance relationship.
</p>
<blockquote>The right reason to offshore your testing is to do it better and more efficiently. If you are doing it for any other reason then you should double check
your motives before you start.</blockquote>

<h2>Models</h2>
<p>
Once you have decided to explore an offshore testing function, you have a few things to consider. Do you want to use a third party provider or are you going to build your own
captive offshore centre? Where are you going to put it? Where will it report into the organisation? Who will run it? Do you need to second people offshore to set it up?
How long a commitment are you going to make? How will the rest of your organisation need to change if this is to be successful?
</p><p>
    The answers to these questions are going to depend a lot on the specific details of your organisation but we can look in general at the models that you should consider.
</p>
<h3>Location and Captive vs Outsourced</h3>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/Manila.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 0px 0px; ">
<p>
All of my experience with offshoring has been in India and Manila. There are other locations that also offer good skills, especially in other parts of Asia,
but I don't know enough about them to discuss them from first hand experience. For the purpose of this article we will restrict the discussion to India and The Philippines
but much of the thinking should be transferable to other locations.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to properly understand the job markets that your testers will be coming from. The location and how the job markets operate are significant factors in how
    you set up your team. Specifically the Indian job market can be difficult to navigate and we recommend going through a local third party provider if you want to set up
    in India. Most IT staff are on a three month notice period which gives you a long lead for hiring. There also isn't much loyalty assumed after a job offer has been accepted
    and it is not uncommon to find that someone that has accepted your job offer will find a better offer just before they are due to start with you. This can mean that even after
    the recruitment process has been completed, you may still wait another 3 months and even then not get anyone to fill your role.
</p>
<p>
    Local outsourcers are prepared for this and have the volume of staff to cope with problems. By using a local provider in India you will be buffered from these issues and you
    can gain access to the highly skilled and very deep Indian IT markets.
</p>
<p>
    The Philippines on the other hand is well suited to building a captive centre. The job market is much more straightforward and there is a higher level of maturity.
    There are also a lot of third parties available if you want to go down the outsourcing path. The Philippine market is not as deep as India and the skills are generally
    not as good as the IT skills available in India but the big exception to this is testing where the skills are at least as well developed.
</p>
<p>
    Testing is treated as a true career in Manila. In many other locations there is a preference for being a developer or a BA or a project manager, but in Manila at least as many people
    aspire to being testers. This means that the quality of staff (especially at the more junior levels) is excellent.
</p>
<p>
    If you aren't really sure that you want to commit long term to an offshore testing team, or you just want to take it slowly, then organisations such as <a href="http://www.yempo-solutions.com">
    Yempo</a> offer an alternative. They will hire the staff for you and manage them in The Philippines and allow you to break off and form your own captive if things get big enough.
    At 17 Ways we have a partnership with Yempo so if you are interested in us providing a Sydney based offering for you in testing or development, that is backended by staff in
    The Philippines provided by Yempo, then we can do that for you. Alternatively you may choose to deal directly with Yempo yourself of course.

<h3>Organisation Structure</h3>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/org.jpg">
<p>
Commitment and engagement are the key factors in making this work. If you create your offshore testing team as a separate part of your company then your onshore teams
have no incentive to make it work. There will be natural level of resentment anyway when you start offshoring any function and if you don't address this head on then it will
keep coming back to bite you.
</p>
<blockquote>We recommend having your offshore teams report into your onshore teams at the lowest levels possible in the organisation. Make your offshore staff
an integral part of your overall teams.</blockquote>
While no organisational structure is ever perfect, at least while you are building up the teams, we recommend that you make the onshore teams fully responsible for the
success or otherwise of the total function, including the offshore staff. In this way you get much better engagement and more focus on success. It will put more pressure on any
senior management that you have offshore and will give some staff dual reporting lines, but it is the best approach if you want things to work.

<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/measure.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 0px 0px; ">
<p>
Within a few months of starting to set up your offshore testing team someone is certain to ask you how you will measure success.
    They will propose a number of metrics around defect tracking, defects found after release to production, hours of testing
    per function point and probably a whole lot of other things. Your answer should be simple: "We will use the same measures
    that we use for the rest of the company."
</p>
<p>
    Because your testing service is remote and you don't have line of sight management available to you, it is tempting to
    try to come up with some sort of dashboard or measurement system so you can keep an eye on what they are doing. You must
    resist this temptation. It will create an "Us and Them" situation that will be hard to move away from (plus the metrics
    are unlikely to be fully meaningful - you care about the overall delivery of the team, not just your test function). Empower
    your line managers to take whatever action they need to get a good outcome and you will have less angst and more delivery.
