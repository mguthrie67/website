                <h1>An Introduction to Cloud Computing</h1>
                <h3>Part of our CEO Series of articles aimed at business people who need to know more about technology.</h3>
                <p>
                    It is hard to read anything related to technology without coming across the term Cloud Computing.
                    In this article we try to explain what Cloud Computing is all about and to highlight the benefits
                    and challenges of adopting Cloud for your business.
                </p>
                <p>In <a href="cloud vs converged.html">Cloud vs Converged</a> we compare Cloud Computing to the latest
                    incarnation of traditional Data Centre technology - Converged Infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>What Is Cloud?</h2>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/cloud.jpg" alt="Cloud Computing">
<br><br>
                <p>

                    Cloud Computing is the term for any technology solution where the infrastructure is provided for you by a third party.
                    More specifically Cloud usually means one of three things:
</p>
                    <h3>1. Software-As-A-Service (SaaS)</h3>
<p>
    Software-As-A-Service has been around for a long time. Originally just called Hosting, in this model you subscribe to a service
    that provides a full application. Salesforce, Microsoft 365 and Google Docs are examples of SaaS. SaaS came out originally because
    many companies lacked the resources and technical expertise to run large software platforms. To address this vendors offered a
    service whereby they would run the software for you on their infrastructure for a fee.
</p>

<h3>2. Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)</h3>
<p>Platform-As-A-Service is the step below SaaS. In this model rather than providing a whole working application for you, the vendor
provides a component that you can use in your application. Typically this is something like a database or a web server that you then build
on top of with your own application.
</p>
<h3>3. Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IaaS)</h3>
<p>
    Dropping another level down is Infrastructure-As-A-Service. IaaS providers give you access to raw infrastructure on which you can run your
    applications and databases. IaaS comes from Internet companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon and is the area of most current focus.
</p>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/asaservice.png" alt="As A Service Comparison"><br><br>
                <blockquote><span>Watch out for vendors who talk about IaaS but quote adoption rates and levels of success
                    that include the much more mature SaaS.</span></blockquote>

<h2>History of IaaS</h2>
<p>Infrastructure-As-A-Service is the most interesting aspect of the Cloud and the area that will have the largest impact on corporate IT.
While traditional corporate IT departments were focussed on building applications with large backend databases running on expensive
servers with fault tolerant hardware that could withstand failures, the newer Internet companies like Amazon and Google were approaching
things in a very different way. Instead of centralised, carefully managed databases and controlled releases of new code, they took almost
the opposite approach. Distributed databases and an expectation that hardware would fail became the norm and a whole new approach to
building applications was used. The key factor for companies like Facebook or Twitter is the ability to get things out quickly and to
keep evolving their platforms. The infrastructure that supports this needs to be highly scalable. They based their infrastructure on
large farms of cheap PCs, rather than the small number of reliable, but expensive servers that are typical in the corporate IT world.
</p>
<p>They had so much success with this that some companies realised they could sell (or rent) their infrastructure to other companies
as IaaS. Amazon are the current leader in this space with Microsoft, IBM, Google and others still a little behind.</p>

<h2>Types of Cloud</h2>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/cloud2.jpg"><br><br>
<p>SaaS is a very different beast to PaaS and IaaS. Because a whole application is delivered with SaaS there is no need for anything
to integrate with it to make it work. It can be delivered using any technology that you like under the covers and all you ever deal with
are the user interfaces that it provides, typically but not always, web pages. In the case of PaaS and IaaS you need technology to interact with
it for it to be useful. This means you need agreed ways of communicating and all of the standard difficulties of IT are exposed to you
such as security, performance and resilience to outages. If you are using PaaS or IaaS then there are different kinds of Cloud that you can
    deal with.</p>
<h3>Public Cloud</h3>
<p>
This is the plain vanilla version. You arrange with a vendor such as Amazon, Google or Microsoft to provide you with
some services, typically a virtual machine running Linux or Windows. You connect to this either over the Internet or through
a more secure private network and you install and run your applications on this virtual machine. The users of the application
connect to it in much the same way. The virtual machines that you use run on very scalable hardware managed by the Cloud provider
who also runs virtual machines for other customers on the same equipment. The biggest advantage, apart from not having to run your own
Data Centre, is that you can scale up and down as you need to. If you normally need 10 virtual machines to run your application but at
month end you need 100 then no problem. You only pay for what you use at the time.
</p>

<h3>Private Cloud</h3>
<p>
Alternative known as "Not the Cloud". In this model companies run their own Cloud within their Data Centre. Rather than using Amazon or Microsoft
as their provider they provision this internally. There are a few reasons for doing this. The main one is to be "Cloud Ready" as companies look
to redevelop their applications for the Cloud but are not yet fully comfortable with moving there or are awaiting regulatory approval to do so.
Another reason for running a Private Cloud is as part of a Hybrid Cloud solution which is covered next.
</p>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/PrivateCloud.jpg" alt="Private Cloud Diagram"><br><br>
<p>One of the issues with Private Cloud is that the definitions are very loose. Some organisations have re-defined their existing
infrastructure to be Private Cloud without actually changing anything. This is one of the things that makes understanding true Cloud adoption rates
very difficult.</p>
<p>This quote from Larry Ellison, Chairman of Oracle<sup>1</sup> perhaps sums up some of the difficulties with understanding Cloud:
</p>
<p>
<i>“The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we’ve redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do.
I can’t think of anything that isn’t cloud computing with all of these announcements...Maybe
    I’m an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It’s complete gibberish.
It’s insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?”</i>
</p>
<h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
<p>
Hybrid Cloud is a mixture of Private Cloud and one or more Public Clouds. With Hybrid Cloud you can choose dynamically what runs on
your own, private infrastructure and what runs on the Public Cloud. You can use Public Cloud for your burst capacity or as a
disaster recovery option for your Private Cloud. Hybrid Cloud is a very sensible option for companies looking to hedge some of the
risks with Public Cloud while still getting the benefit of the burst capacity and lower overheads.
</p>

<h3>Cloud Brokers</h3>
The way you deploy your applications on the Cloud depends on which Cloud provider you use. This gives CTOs quite a headache.
Do you commit to a single provider and lock yourself in to one technology, do you develop everything twice for two providers to maintain
flexibility or do you use a Cloud Broker which is yet another piece of software that you are tied into? A Cloud Broker works by being able to
deploy your applications to multiple Cloud providers. So rather than having to learn the different languages that Amazon and Microsoft etc
speak, you can just learn the language that the Cloud Broker speaks and it will translate it for you depending on which Cloud provider you
want to use this time. With no standards yet defined for Cloud providers a Cloud Broker is a good idea. Unfortunately the market here is
immature and still evolving so picking the right Cloud Broker is not easy, nor guaranteed to be the right choice in the future.
<h3>Other Cloud Types</h3>
<p>As Larry Ellison pointed out above there is a lot of jargon and nonsense associated with Cloud Computing. There are other terms
used to describe the Cloud world such as Community Cloud, Intercloud and even fog and Legacy Cloud (as in, not Cloud at all).
We suggest you avoid people who use these terms excessively, they are the same people who used to promise us a paperless office
and told us we'd all die in Y2K.</p>


<blockquote>The Cloud isn't magic. Your applications don't really run in a Cloud, they run in a Data Centre, just one that
someone else looks after instead of you.</blockquote>
<h2>Adoption Rates</h2>
<p>It is hard to get a proper picture of Cloud adoption rates by corporates for a number of reasons. Most figures come from surveys
which are usually directed at CIOs. Due to its nature, a lot of SaaS usage is initiated and managed directly by business units often without
the knowledge of the IT department. It is probably safe to say that most figures on the adoption of SaaS are understated. There is a large level
of hype around Cloud and CIOs are under pressure from CEOs to ensure that the company has a strategy around moving to the Cloud and
adopting IaaS. We will address some of the challenges with this below but it is rare to find an organisation that is not doing something
with the Cloud (Only 8% of organisations don't have a plan to use Cloud<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>
While the numbers can be hard to understand and often conflicting, it is clear that corporates are putting a lot of effort into the Cloud.
    Australia leads the way with 86% of companies running at least one production application in the Cloud<sup>3</sup> compared to
    only 50% in the USA and 60% in Europe. A large amount of this is SaaS which is different to IaaS and a lot more mature.
    4 out of 5 corporates around the world are intending to use the Cloud for mission critical applications in the next 2 years<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>We have collated some general statistics to show the overall picture<sup>4-6</sup>:</p>
<img src="../../images/Library/CEO/cloudstats.jpg" alt="Cloud statistics"><br><br>


<h2>Strengths - Why Use The Cloud?</h2>
There are a number of major factors driving the move to the Cloud, the most common being:<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>Move from Capex to Opex</li>
    <li>Cost</li>
    <li>Flexibility</li>
    <li>Burst Capacity</li>
</ol>
Most of these really apply to IaaS and less so to SaaS. Lets take a look at each of these in turn.
<h3>1. Move from Capex to Opex</h3>
<p>
    A lot of organisations are drawn to Cloud because it removes the need to purchase large expensive Data Centre equipment.
    The ability to pay a monthly fee for infrastructure on a pay-per-use basis is appealing.
</p>
<blockquote>At 17 Ways we believe this argument is overstated and often not true.</blockquote>

<p>While having large, lumpy IT infrastructure costs on the books is unappealing, there are other ways to address this problem.
IT leasing is readily available and achieves the same thing. We recommend that you look at this before committing to a Cloud
    strategy that is based upon moving from Capex to Opex. If you run a Private Cloud, which we recommend, then you will
    need to address this problem anyway. One of the major issues with Public Cloud is the uncertainty of your costs. The models
    are usually based upon usage with different rates for fixed baseline, variable use and one-off workloads. We recommend
    that you look very closely at the cost of running your Public Cloud and negotiate hard with the providers before committing
    to anything. Getting rid of major capital expenditure may be appealing to begin with but replacing it with far higher
    monthly charges will not be well received.
</p>

<h3>2. Cost</h3>
<p>
50% of corporate decision makers believe that moving to the Cloud will be cheaper. We expect that many of them will be disappointed.
New technologies are rarely cheaper, at least to begin with. A significant part of the cost of running infrastructure is people -
Gartner estimate it is 41% of the total cost<sup>7</sup>. It is a harsh reality that this cost is likely to go up before it comes
down. Managing Cloud environments is still an immature area and people with these skills command a higher salary. You need to properly
understand your people costs and not just focus on the infrastructure costs.
</p>
<p>
    We know of an organisation with an infrastructure department of around 50 people that is looking to move to the Cloud.
    The high level cost estimates include redeploying these 50 staff to other activities. However on closer inspection only
    3 of the 50 staff are directly involved in hardware deployment. The other 47 are working on ancilliary activities such as monitoring,
    patching and security services. While those 3 people won't be needed once the Cloud strategy is fully implemented, the rest
    of the team will likely have to grow significantly to manage the new Cloud world.
</p>
<p>
    Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) needs to really mean that. Many of the TCO numbers used to support a Cloud migration only address
    the cost of infrastructure and neglect to include additional costs for people and knock on effects to other departments. Often
    the extra cost of redeveloping applications to work in the Cloud is left out of the calculation.
</p>
<p>We believe the Cloud and especially IaaS offer real benefits to organisations, however the area is still very immature
and it is important that corporates especially look at the full picture before making decisions on Cloud migration.</p>
<h3>3. Flexibility</h3>
<p>The Cloud offers major benefits due to its flexibility. If you can overcome the other challenges then you have a great
platform to work on. The ability to deploy environments dynamically and without the risk of impacting other systems is
probably the main driver for moving to the Cloud. The area that benefits most from this is IT Development and Testing.
IT staff constantly need to run up new copies of the system to test out and often only need them for a short amount of time.
With proper automation tools this flexibility can have a massive impact on productivity.</p>
<h3>4. Burst Capacity</h3>
<p>The ability to scale up and down as you need to is another massive benefit of the Public Cloud. Be cautious of the
variable nature of your costs and ensure that you properly monitor your usage. You will only get a real benefit here
if you develop your applications to scale across the Cloud. Don't expect that you can pick up existing applications and
they will just work in the Cloud as this is unlikely to be true.</p>
<blockquote>Flexibility and Burst Capacity are the real benefits of Public Cloud. Focus on applications that will benefit from this.</blockquote>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>A New Way of Working</h3>
The reason why Internet companies like Google and Amazon were able to approach their IT development so differently was
that they were trying to solve a different set of problem from the ones that faced their counterparts in the corporate
world. The corporate world is still driven by the need for reliability, auditability and guaranteed performance.
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take a cautious approach to the Cloud and apply healthy scepticism to anyone selling you Cloud services.</li>
    <li>Think through all aspects of the changes and include extra monitoring and management as a factor.</li>
    <li>Be prepared for significant organisational change if you are to make the most use of the Cloud.</li>
    <li>Use SaaS services wherever possible. They are generally more mature than other Cloud services and can offer real opportunity
    for better and cheaper service.</li>
    <li>Consider the data ownership issues thoroughly even for SaaS.</li>
    <li>Have a migration or exit plan for any relationship with a Cloud provider.</li>
    <li>Prioritise new applications that fit the Cloud model over migration of older applications. Be aware that
    IaaS is not going to be suitable for all of your applications.</li>
    <li>Negotiate with Cloud providers. Do not accept their offerings as fixed and inflexible.</li>
    <li>Look at leasing equipment if you want to move from Opex to Capex.</li>
</ol>
