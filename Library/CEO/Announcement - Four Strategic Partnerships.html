<h2>3rd July 2015</h2>
<p>We are very pleased to announce today that we have formed four strategic partnerships to allow us to resell and advise on technologies that
we believe are the current leaders in their fields. The four alliances are with VCE, SimpliVity, Avaya and ScienceLogic. We chose these partners
    as they all have strong and complimentary offerings in the Data Centre space.
</p>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
At 17 Ways we aim to provide high quality assistance to companies looking to evolve their technology solutions. We feel that the best way to do
this is to partner with the technology providers that we believe offer the best products. By having deep understanding of the products that
we recommend and sell, as well as inside information on the direction for the product, we are well placed to give you the right advice.
<h3>Does being a reseller compromise the independence of our advice?</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as truly independent advice in the IT industry. Everyone has an angle whether it is undisclosed kickbacks from vendors
or just personal bias. At 17 Ways we are upfront about our relationships and the technologies that we believe are the best. That doesn't mean we will
push those technologies if they aren't the right answer for our customers though. The most important thing for us is our reputation. We will only
ever recommend solutions that we believe will work. By having these close relationships we are much better placed to be able to decide if a
solution will be right for your requirements or not.</p>
<p>
    Additionally by being partners with these vendors we can be much more involved in the implementations ensuring that we drive towards
    successful conclusions by having more skin in the game. With all technology there is a lot more to being successful than just picking the right
    solution. With our experience of working on the customer side we believe we can add significant value to your business with our pre and post
    sales support.
</p>
<p>
    Technology resellers used to be called VARs(Value Added Resellers) and although the term has fallen into disuse we believe that is very much the space that
    we play in, helping customers to achieve results that they might not have achieved without our help.
</p>
<blockquote>Customer outcome is the most important thing for us. We are a small company and we need referrals and repeat business in order to survive. Despite our
fully disclosed relationships with vendors, we will never push a solution that we don't believe to be the best choice for our customers.</blockquote>

<h2>VCE</h2>
<p>
17 Ways are a reseller of VCE's converged and hyper-converged enterprise technologies. VCE's Vblock systems are an ideal platform for running your core x86 workloads. VCE are a joint venture
between EMC, VMWare and Cisco to build fully integrated, converged systems that combine the best available components into a single system that has been fully tested and is ready to deploy
upon delivery.

<h2>SimpliVity</h2>
<p>
SimpliVity are a startup company in the hyper-converged space with $101M of financing behind them. They offer the best platform for running a virtualised farm that we have seen.
SimpliVity handles absolutely everything that you need below the hypervisor level including de-duplication, compression and automated backups. It is exciting new
technology that is perfect for many uses such as VDI, Branch Office, Data Centre consolidation and development and testing. For smaller organisations a SimpliVity
system may be all that need in your Data Centre (in fact 65% of SimpliVity customers use nothing else).

available today.</blockquote>

<h2>ScienceLogic</h2>
<p>
    ScienceLogic's EM7 monitoring tool is built to provide the management capabilities required in a hybrid and virtualised world. It represents
    the next evolution of monitoring and we believe it is an essential component for any successful implementation of converged, hyper-converged or
    cloud system.

the hardware options that we sell and completes a practical and compelling range of Data Centre technologies.</blockquote>
