<h2>3rd July 2015</h2>
<p>We are very pleased to announce today that we have formed four strategic partnerships to allow us to resell and advise on technologies that
we believe are the current leaders in their fields. The four alliances are with VCE, SimpliVity, Avaya and ScienceLogic. We chose these partners
    as they all have strong and complimentary offerings in the Data Centre space.
</p>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
At 17 Ways we aim to provide high quality assistance to companies looking to evolve their technology solutions. We feel that the best way to do
this is to partner with the technology providers that we believe offer the best products. By having deep understanding of the products that
we recommend and sell, as well as inside information on the direction for the product, we are well placed to give you the right advice.
<h3>Does being a reseller compromise the independence of our advice?</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as truly independent advice in the IT industry. Everyone has an angle whether it is undisclosed kickbacks from vendors
or just personal bias. At 17 Ways we are upfront about our relationships and the technologies that we believe are the best. That doesn't mean we will
push those technologies if they aren't the right answer for our customers though. The most important thing for us is our reputation. We will only
ever recommend solutions that we believe will work.</p>
<blockquote>Customer outcome is the most important thing for us. We are a small company and we need referrals and repeat business in order to survive. Despite our
fully disclosed relationships with vendors, we will never push a solution that we don't believe to be the best choice for our customers.</blockquote>
