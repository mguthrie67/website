                <br>

        <h2>Other Professional Services</h2>
        <img src="images/professionals.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 15px;">
        <p>
        From time to time your company will need the assistance of a professional such a lawyer, tax advisor, accountant or auditor. If your company is large enough then you can retain these
        services internally but if you don't need them full time then there are many companies who can provide someone to help you.
            </p>
        <p>Typically you get assigned someone who has worked with you
        before and knows your business, so you don't need to explain everything from scratch each time you deal with them. They charge a rate based upon how much you use and when you
        don't need them, you don't pay.</p>
        <p>It's a model that is well established and proven to work.</p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
        <h2>Not so with Technology</h2>
        <blockquote>Technology is one of the least advanced professional services in this respect.</blockquote>
        Unfortunately with IT, things don't work so well. You can get very skilled technicians who can fix your network or upgrade your PC...
        <img src="images/technician.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
        <br>
        ..but sometimes you need something more advanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/consultants.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 15px;">

            This is when you find that there is a big gap between contract technicians and the big end of town where the major consultancy firms operate.
            Experiences with large consulting firms vary a lot but it often seems that they are much more interested in growing their business than they are in
            helping you with yours.
        <br>
        <br>
        This leaves you either needing to hire someone full time when you don't really want to, or struggling away on your own and borrowing advice from friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a good reason for this, most of the senior staff are employed as CIOs at other companies or are working for the consulting firms.
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>This offering is aimed at companies who need occasional help with their technology.
            Typically they will have a functioning set of technology and a capable internal or outsourced IT function,
            but need more senior assistance with technology decisions or transitions.
        </p>
        <h2>Options</h2>
        <img src="images/pricing.jpg">
        <h2>Inclusions</h2>

        </p>
