Hi ,

Long time no see.

John Tufts, Tim Mallyon and I have left Macquarie and formed our own company, 17 Ways. We are doing a mix of things including reselling harware, software development and consulting.

On the hardware side we have signed up as a reseller of SimpliVity's hyperconverged technology. This is a new technology just launched in Australia and we think it is very good. We thought you might be interested in taking a look at it.

We are holding a launch on 23rd June at Establishment. If you would like to take a look at it, we'd love to have you there. At the moment we are only inviting people that we have worked with in the past.

You can find more information here: http://17ways.com.au/Simplivity and the invite is here: http://17ways.com.au/mailout/001/Invite%2023rd%20June%202015.html.

Let me know if you are able to come along, it should be a good event.

cheers

Mark
