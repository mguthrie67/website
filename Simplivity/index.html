            <h2>What Is Hyperconverged?</h2>
            <p>
                In the traditional Data Centre model dedicated components provide highly specialised functions such as storage,
                networking, backup, compute and compression. With converged infrastructure some of these components are
                placed into a single box, typically the compute, networking and storage. With hyper-converged
                all of the components are combined into a single small device. For more capacity, you add more
                nodes to the cluster. This is a similar model to the Web-Scale approach taken by large Internet companies such
                as Amazon or Google.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Simplivity/hyper.jpg" width="400">
            <h2>What is SimpliVity?</h2>
            <p>Simply put, SimpliVity is a Data Centre in a box. It is a single device (only 2RU in size) that
                contains everything that you need to run your applications and infrastructure. If you need more
                capacity simply add another SimpliVity OmniCube.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that is only the beginning. SimpliVity provides advanced data management functions such as
                de-duplication and compression, automated timed backups and blisteringly fast VMWare copies. By compressing
                and de-duplicating the data the first time it is seen, SimpliVity dramatically reduces the disk space
                requirements while at the same time improving performance. In fact more than 20% of SimpliVity customers
                get better than 100:1 compression ratios. This not only allows you to store more data before you need
                to expand but more importantly by reducing the physical IO it improves the performance.
            </p>

                    <li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="toggle('question1')">You’ve been chasing your storage engineers for 6 weeks to provision a new LUN so you can run up some VMs.</a>
                        <div id="question1" class="borderdiv" style="display: none">

                            <h3>Lead Time for Storage</h3>
                            Storage is complicated and needs specialised storage engineers to provision new LUNs or extend storage. Storage considerations
                            need to be at the forefront of project manager's minds as lead times on storage can have a massive impact on project deadlines. Operations managers and service owners
                            need to be constantly aware of their growth patterns so they can give plenty of warning to the storage teams when increases are needed.
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            With SimpliVity a VMWare Adminstrator can add their own storage. In seconds. That's it.

                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="toggle('question2')">Replication to and from your branch office is hammering your WAN link and your remote backups never complete.</a>
                        <div id="question2" class="borderdiv"  style="display: none">
                            <h3>Branch Office Replication</h3>
                            Replicating data from a remote office back to the central or regional hub takes time. Network compression tools can assist with this but need to be tuned and monitored.
                            It is often not possibly to complete a remote copy within the window available and partial solutions such as replicating specific directories or files is the only
                            option. If weekend replication is possible then at least you can get a full copy once a week if you are lucky.
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            De-dupe and compression means that only new blocks are copied over the WAN. Even .PST files aren't a problem. Super fast. Super easy. No configuration.

                    <li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="toggle('question3')">Disaster recovery testing is almost as bad as the disaster itself and you don’t really know if it is going to work like it should.</a>

                            <h3>Business Continuity Testing</h3>
                            IT infrastructure is complicated. In order to do a proper test for an application or a system you need significant downtime. Failing all of the components
                            across to the disaster recovery facility is a major task with networks, storage, VMs, compute systems and who knows what else all needing to be in sync. Forget
                            anything more than basic testing as you need all the time and a good amount of luck to get the systems failed back over to production in the window available.
                            There is no chance you can do a single application at a time even in a true disaster scenario, everything is interconnected and complex. Not you? Everything works perfectly
                            in your world? Well have you ever tested everything in a BCP window? What about your backups and restores?
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            Pick a VM. Copy it to the remote site if it isn't already there (in seconds). Start it up.

                            <h3>VDI (Virtual Desktop Interface)</h3>
                            Desktop PCs are cheap to buy but expensive to manage. You'd love to use a VDI solution for some of your users but the costs don't add up. You can do it on
                            cheap disk with a cheaper solution but it still doesn't come in at less than real desktops and doesn't address any of your problems with the desktop environment
                            such as backup of PCs, or better control of the environment. It's good enough for a remote access solution but not much else. You can also do it on your high end
                            systems which give you the benefits you need but running this on tier 1 or even tier 2 storage makes it uneconomical.

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            De-dupe is especially good for VDI. SimpliVity is a very cost effective solution.

                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li><a href="javascript:;" onclick="toggle('question5')">Scaling up capacity should be easy, but it’s almost as hard as building a new system all over again.</a>
                        <div id="question5" class="borderdiv"  style="display: none">
                            <h3>Incremental Scaling</h3>
                            Adding capacity to your Data Centre is a major event. You can't scale in small units, it is major steps each time. Any proposal to add capacity to
                            your Data Centre has more zeros in it than a drunk Scotsman at a synchronised swimming event. You dread asking for the increases in capacity that you
                            need because someone is sure to make you spend a month costing it against the Cloud.

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            Add capacity in 2RU units. Only need compute and not storage? Easy, you can connect non-SimpliVity devices to your SimpliVity cluster.

                            <h3>Backup Windows Are Looooong</h3>

                            Forget backing up remote offices, you struggle to backup your critical systems in the Data Centre. Backups take time. Some applications have a backup
                            window that is over 24 hours and the operators kill the previous day's backup so today's can run. Thankfully backups don't attract a lot of attention
                            and aren't part of your KPI's. At least not until a restore is required.


                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            Snapshots however often you need them. Every minute if you like. Fast restores, even to another Data Centre.

                            <h3>vMotion Across Different Geographies</h3>
                            Your BCP plan says that your Melbourne Data Centre will take over from Sydney in the event of a problem. That is fine for major outages (well you think it is,
                            you've never had to do it). For smaller problems you have no workable solution. In order to vMotion a VM from Sydney to Melbourne you need the LUNs failed over.
                            That impacts all applications, what if you only have one failing blade that you want to move the capacity off? You'd like to be able to vMotion the VMs from
                            that blade across to Melbourne but you can't. You'll need to arrange an outage and do it slowly.

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            With SimpliVity the data is already at the other site or if it's not you can move it very quickly. You are only vMotioning the memory.

                            will need to learn a new set of tools, your monitoring will need to be completely upgraded and now instead of 12 tools to do the job you will have 13 or 14.

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            SimpliVity has no UI, it just bolts in to vCenter. Right click and you are away.
